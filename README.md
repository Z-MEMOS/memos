## Deploy with Docker in seconds 🚀  

Run the following command to quickly deploy Memos using Docker:  

```bash
docker run -d --name memos -p 5230:5230 -v ~/.memos/:/var/opt/memos neosmemo/memos:stable
```

### What This Command Does:
- `-d` → Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).  
- `--name memos` → Names the container `memos`.  
- `-p 5230:5230` → Maps **port 5230** on your machine to **port 5230** in the container.  
- `-v ~/.memos/:/var/opt/memos` →  
  - `~/.memos/` is the **local directory** where your data will be stored.  
  - `/var/opt/memos` is the **Docker container’s storage path** (do not modify this).  


> [!NOTE]
> This command is only applicable for Unix/Linux systems. For Windows, please refer to the detailed [documentation](https://www.usememos.com/docs/install/container-install#docker-on-windows).
>
> The `~/.memos/` directory will be used as the data directory on your local machine, while `/var/opt/memos` is the directory of the volume in Docker and should not be modified.
